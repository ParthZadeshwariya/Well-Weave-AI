**Well-Weave AI** is an innovative mental wellness journaling app powered by AI. Users can pour their thoughts into a digital journal, where advanced AI analysis (via Google Gemini) extracts emotions, concepts, people, and triggers to build a **dynamic mind graph**.  

Visualize your emotional patterns, explore connections, and chat with an empathetic AI guide for insights, advice, and support. For serious topics like depression or suicidal thoughts, the guide provides **helpline resources** to ensure user safety.

This full-stack React app combines intuitive UI/UX with AI-driven personalization to foster **self-awareness and emotional growth**.

## âœ¨ Features

- **AI-Powered Journaling**: Write or speak entries; Gemini AI analyzes text to identify emotions (e.g., anxiety, joy), people, activities, and triggers.  
- **Dynamic Mind Graph**: Interactive force-directed visualization of thoughts using custom layout algorithms. Nodes spread out uncluttered, with animations (fade-in, pulse, scale) and zoom/pan support.  
- **AI Guide Chatbot**: Converse about your graph (e.g., *"What triggers my stress?"*), get personalized advice, and receive empathetic responses. Detects serious mental health topics and provides helplines (e.g., US: **988 Suicide Prevention Lifeline**).  
- **Voice Input**: Record voice notes with placeholder speech-to-text (extensible to real STT).  
- **Privacy-Focused**: Client-side processing; no data stored server-side (local state only).  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a modern, accessible design.
